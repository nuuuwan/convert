\section*{Toponymy}

In antiquity, Sri Lanka was known to travellers by a variety of names. According to the Mahvasa, the legendary Prince Vijaya named the island Tambapa (\say{copper-red hands} or \say{copper-red earth}), because his followers' hands were reddened by the red soil of the area where he landed.[20][21] In Hindu mythology, the term Lank (\say{Island}) appears but it is unknown whether it refers to the island. The Tamil term Eelam (Tamil: , romanized: am) was used to designate the whole island in Sangam literature.[22][23] The island was known under Chola rule as Mummudi Cholamandalam (\say{realm of the three crowned Cholas}).[24]
